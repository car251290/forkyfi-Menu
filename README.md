# JavaScript ES6 
A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all the types,
values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax and semantics described in this specification.

# Recipe 
to get the recipe of PIZZA or to spaguitty and prepare it, this App will help you to get different dishes and the ingredientes of it.

# Start using ES6 
These are some example of what I use in the code.

# The Undefined Type
The Undefined type has exactly one value, called undefined. Any variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined.

# The Null Type
The Null type has exactly one value, called null.

# The Boolean Type
The Boolean type represents a logical entity having two values, called true and false.

# ECMAScript operations that do not interpret String contents apply no further semantics. Operations that do interpret String values treat each element as a single UTF-16 code unit
